    <h1>TOPIC: Logic Operators. Selection Statements. Loops</h1>
    <h2>Task 1.3.1:</h2>
    <p>You should decide which selection operator is better to use for each task: <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code> or <code>?:</code> ternary operator.</p>
    <p>1. Ask the user for a number from 0 to 9 and display the special character located on this key (1-!, 2-@, 3-#, etc.).</p>
    <button onclick="charByNumber()">Display character</button>
    <p>2. Ask the user for the year and check whether it is a leap year or not. A leap year is either a multiple of 400 or a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 100.</p>
    <button onclick="isLeapYear()">Check the year</button>
    <p>3. Request a date (day, month, year) and display the next date. Consider the possibility of moving to the next month, year, as well as leap year.</p>
    <button onclick="getNextDate()">Get next date</button>

    <h2>Task 1.3.2:</h2>
    <p>You should decide which type of a loop is better to use for each task: <code>while</code>, <code>do while</code> or <code>for</code>.</p>
    <p>1. Calculate the sum of all numbers in the range specified by the user.</p>
    <button onclick="calculateSum()">Calculate the sum</button>
    <p>2. Determine the number of digits in the entered number.</p>
    <button onclick="countDigits()">Count digits</button>
    <p>3. Ask the user for 10 numbers and count how many positive, negative and zeros were entered. Besides, also count how many even and odd numbers present. Display statistics on the screen. Try to use only one variable in the solution.</p>
    <button onclick="getNumbersInfo()">Get information about numbers</button>
    <p>4. Loop the output of the weekdays as follows: <code>{Day of the week}. Do you want to see the next day?</code> and so on until the user clicks OK.</p>
    <button onclick="getNextWeekday()">Get next weekday</button>
