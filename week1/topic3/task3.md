# TOPIC: Logic Operators. Selection Statements. Loops

## Task 1.3.1:

You should decide which selection operator is better to use for each task: `if`, `switch` or `?:` ternary operator.
1. Ask the user for a number from 0 to 9 and display the special character located on this key (1-!, 2-@, 3-#, etc.).
2. Ask the user for the year and check whether it is a leap year or not. A leap year is either a multiple of 400 or a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 100.
3. Request a date (day, month, year) and display the next date. Consider the possibility of moving to the next month, year, as well as leap year.

## Task 1.3.2:

You should decide which type of a loop is better to use for each task: `while`, `do while` or `for`.
1. Calculate the sum of all numbers in the range specified by the user.
2. Determine the number of digits in the entered number.
3. Ask the user for 10 numbers and count how many positive, negative and zeros were entered. Besides, also count how many even and odd numbers present. Display statistics on the screen. Try to use only one variable in the solution.
4. Loop the output of the weekdays as follows: `{Day of the week}. Do you want to see the next day?` and so on until the user clicks OK.
