# TOPIC: Data Types. Operators

## Task 2:

Request userâ€™s data and show the results by using **prompt()** and **alert()** dialogs.

1. Implement the kilometers to miles unit converter. The user inputs a value in km, and then the app displays this value in miles (1 km = 0,621371 miles). Use a constant here.
2. Ask the user for the current time (hours, minutes). Calculate how many hours and minutes are left until the end of the day.
3. Ask the user for the 3-digit number and display it backwards. Try to use the % (division remainder) operator.
